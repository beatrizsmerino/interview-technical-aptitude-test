# Zataca Systems / Exercise VUE+SCSS

## Description

### Welcome to today's challenge!

In this test you will have the opportunity to demonstrate your skills in `Vue.js` and `SCSS`. The test will last **approximately 1 hour** and will focus on evaluating your skills to create a simple but functional application, as well as your knowledge.

Below, we will provide you with the tasks to perform during the test:

1. Create a `Vue.js` application from scratch with `Vue CLI`.
2. Create a **card component** that displays information about a product, using `SCSS` for styling. For the design part, we want to see your creativity. The card should consist of a **title** and a **description**.
3. Such a component will be used recursively in a **product grid** that is loaded by calling an API to retrieve the data and display it in the application. The `API` to be used is [https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts).
4. Once this grid is created, we must include a **search** engine at the top that allows us to filter these cards looking for matches in **title** and/or **description**.
5. Compress the files and send them to [captacion.talento@zataca.com](captacion.talento@zataca.com) or upload them to your Git and send us the link, as you see fit! One way or another, specify us in the subject of the mail **"FrontEnd level test - Name and surname"** so we can know it's you.

Any additions that you think will improve usability, as well as `UX/UI` optimization with loadings, `header/footer` structuring, etc. will be appreciated.

Remember that this test is just a way to evaluate your skills at the moment. It's always possible to keep learning and improving.

Best of luck, and see you on the other side! ðŸ˜Š
